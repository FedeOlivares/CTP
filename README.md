# CTP

This is the beggining of a web app for my portfolio. 
Is being built with django, will use bootstrap 5 and SQLite3. 

The app will have the hability to register users in, give them a random public username for anonimity, allow them to log in with their private user id, create discussion topics, comment on said topics and leave ratings on professors and classes.
